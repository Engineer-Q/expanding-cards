i am learning web development html and css was not that difficult but when i started javascript i was overwhelmed by javascript so i am starting this series to understand the basic javascript
this is my first project from the "50 days 50 projects" series.

i have tried my best to complete this mini project without watching the tutorial just to get the basic understanding of javascript
